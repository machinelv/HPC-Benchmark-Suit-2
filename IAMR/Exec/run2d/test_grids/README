In this directory are six sets of inputs, probin and fixed_grids 
files which are used to test different grid configurations and problem
set-ups.  

The grid configurations are in files fixed_grids_1 through fixed_grids_6.
Associated with each is a set of inputs files, inputs_1_... through inputs_6.
and probin files, probin_1 through probin_6.   

There is also a plot file (plt0000_1 through plt0000_6) for each 
grid configuration so you can see the grid configurations.

******************************************************************************

fixed_grids_1/{inputs_1_xy_xper, inputs_1_xy_xsolid, inputs_1_rz}/probin_1 :

4 level 0 grids, 2 level 1 grids, 2 level 2 grids.

This is the only case with multiple level 0 grids.  It also has
level 2 grid boundaries overlaying level 1 grid boundaries overlaying
level 0 grid boundaries.  None of the fine grids touch the physical
boundaries.

Refinement ratio: 2 and 2.

The problem is based on inputs.2d.hotspot, and has nonzero divu.

This can be run with x-y with solid wall or periodic in the x-direction,
or r-z with solid in the r-direction. It uses solid wall in the 
low-y direction and outflow in the high-y direction 
(must use outflow because divu != 0).

******************************************************************************

fixed_grids_2/{inputs_2_xy_ysolid, inputs_2_xy_yinflow, 
               inputs_2_rz_zsolid, inputs_2_rz_zinflow}/probin_2 :

1 level 0 grid, 2 level 1 grids, 3 level 2 grids

This is the only case set up to test inflow.  One of the level 1
grids and two of the level 2 grids touch the low-y inflow face. This
has a level 2 grid spanning a level 1 grid interface.

Refinement ratio: 4 and 2.

The problem is based on inputs.2d.hotspot, and has nonzero divu.

This can be run with x-y or r-z, with solid wall in
the x-direction.   It uses solid wall or inflow in the low-y direction and
outflow in the high-y direction (must use outflow because divu != 0).

******************************************************************************

fixed_grids_3/{inputs_3}/probin_3 : 

1 level 0 grid, 3 level 1 grids, 3 level 2 grids

Refinement ratio: 4 and 2.

The problem is based on inputs.2d.hotspot, and has nonzero divu.

This should be run with x-y and periodic in the x-direction,
solid wall in the low-y direction and outflow in the high-y direction 
(must use outflow because divu != 0).  This is especially
useful for the periodic grid interfaces.

******************************************************************************

fixed_grids_4/{inputs_4}/probin_4 : 

1 level 0 grid, 5 level 1 grids

Refinement ratio: 2 

The problem is based on inputs.2d.viscbench, and has divu=0.

This is doubly periodic, and is useful for testing periodic interfaces
as well as different types of corners (inside, outside, diagonal).

******************************************************************************

fixed_grids_5/{inputs_5}/probin_5 : 

1 level 0 grid, 7 level 1 grids

Refinement ratio: 2 

The problem is based on inputs.2d.viscbench, and has divu=0.

This is doubly periodic, and is useful for testing periodic grid interfaces.

******************************************************************************

fixed_grids_6/{inputs_6}/probin_6 :

1 level 0 grid, 4 level 1 grid, 3 level 2 grids

Refinement ratio: 2 2

This problem is based on inputs.2d.viscbench, and has divu=0.

It is periodic in the x-direction and has some nasty level 1/2 and 
level 0/1 interfaces.  It is useful for testing periodic grid interfaces.
