4D FOKKER-PLANCK MODEL FOR A 3-BUS POWER SYSTEM
(Equilibrium case)

  dp    d[mu(x_i)p]              d^2 p
  -- +  -----------  = f_ij(t) --------- ; i,j = 1,2,3,4
  dt        dx_i               dx_i dx_j

  p(x_i,t) : Probability distribution
  x_1      : Phase of generator 1 
  x_2      : Phase of generator 2
  x_3      : Angular speed of generator 1 
  x_4      : Angular speed of generator 2

This is an equilibrium case where the initial probability density
function consists of a Dirac located at an equilibrium:
x0 such that: mu(x0) = = 0.0

The initial Dirac should not advect and just dissipate at its equi-
librium location depending on physical dissipation.

If the noise is set to zero, then the initial solution is the 
exact solution and one should see machine-zero residuals during
time-integration.

** Note: the initial equilibrium *has* to fall on a grid point and
hence the grid and initial solution should be generated accordingly.
The file to generate the initial solution (aux/init.c) achieves this
by correcting the input parameters slightly.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

  ** If input_mode is "parallel" in solver.inp, then 
  initial_par.inp can be generated by compiling
  and running hypar/Extras/ParallelInput.c after
  generating initial.inp.

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 

**IMPORTANT** Generating the initial solution (initial.inp)
may alter the physics.inp file, so make a backup copy of it.
