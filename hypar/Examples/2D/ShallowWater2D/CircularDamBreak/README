  h   - water height
  u   - x-velocity
  v   - y-velocity

  b(x,y) - bottom topography (b_x denotes d[b(x}]/dx)
  g      - acceleration due to gravity

Circular Dam-Break:

  Breaking of a circular dam.

Domain:

  0 <= x,y <= 50
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Bottom topography:

  b(x,y) = 0.0 (constant)
  
Initial Solution:

  h(x,y) = 10.0  if r <= 11
           1.0   otherwise
  u(x,y) = 0.0

  where r^2 = (x-25.0)^2 + (y-25.0)^2

Note: Since the bottom topography is constant, one can either 
provide the file "topography.inp" specifying a flat surface,
or skip it.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution (not included, 
                    but can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file (initial.inp) in the correct format required 
by the solver.
