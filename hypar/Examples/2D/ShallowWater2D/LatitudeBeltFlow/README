  d   [ h   ]   d   [   h*u            ]   d  [     h*v         ]   [   0      ]   [   0  ]

  h   - water height
  u   - x-velocity
  v   - y-velocity

  b(x,y) - bottom topography (b_x denotes d[b(x}]/dx)
  g      - acceleration due to gravity

  f      - Coriolis force   
           f = f_hat + beta * (y - D/2)
           where D is the channel width, and f_hat, beta
           are Coriolis force parameters.

Flow through "Latitude Belt":

  Flow through a "limited-area" channel that represents a latitude belt.

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 6,000,000 meters
  0 <= y <= 4,400,000 meters
  "periodic" boundary conditions at x = 0 and 6,000,000
  "shallow-water-no-slip" boundary conditions at y = 0 and 4,400,000

Bottom topography:

  b(x,y) = 0.0 (constant) (hence no need of "topography.inp" file).

Initial Solution:

  See equations (4.1) and (4.2) in reference.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution (not included, 
                    but can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file (initial.inp) in the correct format required 
by the solver.
