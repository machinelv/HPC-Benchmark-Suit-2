2D BURGERS EQUATION

  du     d[0.5 u^2]    d[0.5 u^2]
  --  +  ---------- +  ----------  = 0
  dt         dx            dy

  0 <= x,y <= 1; Periodic

Initial Solution:
  
  u(x,y,0) = (1/2 t_s pi) * sin(2 pi x) sin (2 pi y)
  t_s = 2 (time to shock formation)

Exact Solution (final time < t_s):
  u(x,y,t) = sin[ 2 pi (x-u(x,y,t) t) ] sin [2 pi (y-u(x,y,t) t) ] / (2 t_s pi)
  Needs to be computed iteratively using the fixed point method.


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
It will be generated by the same code if the final time is 
less than t_s.
