2D LINEAR DIFFUSION

  du         d^2 u        d^2 u
  --  = nu_x ----- + nu_y ----- 
  dt         dx^2          dy^2

  0 <= x,y <= 1; Periodic
  nu_x = diffusion coefficient along x
  nu_y = diffusion coefficient along y

Initial Solution:
  
  u(x,y,0) = u0(x,y) = sin(m pi x) sin(n pi y)
  (m = n = 2)

Exact solution:
                               
  u(x,y,t) = exp(-pi^2 (nu_x*m^2 + nu_y*n^2) t) u0(x,y)
                                 

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
                    (diffusion coeffs along each dimension)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/exact.c is an example to generate the initial
and exact solution files in the correct format required by the solver.
