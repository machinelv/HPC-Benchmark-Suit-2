2D EULER EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]    d  [   rho*v   ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] +  -- [  rho*u*v  ] = 0
  dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [   rho*u*v  ]    dy [rho*v*v + p]
      [   e   ]       [   (e+p)*u  ]       [  (e+p)v   ]

  rho   - density
  u     - x-velocity
  v     - y-velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
        gamma-1      2


This example tests the sponge BC implementation for the 
isentropic vortex convection problem.

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 20.0
  subsonic inflow and outflow boundary conditions
  0 <= y <= 10.0
  "periodic" boundary conditions

The sponge BC is applied on the right half of the
domain (10 < x <= 20), with the reference state
being the freestream.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution, can be generated
                    by compiling and running aux/init.c

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files


Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
