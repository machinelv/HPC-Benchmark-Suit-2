Inviscid, Isentropic Vortex Convection:

  ICASE Report 97-65, 1997

  Convection of an inviscid, isentropic vortex 
  that is the exact solution of the Euler equations
  (Navier-Stokes without the viscosity).

Domain:

  0 <= x,y <= 10.0
  "periodic" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:

  Freestream conditions -
  
    rho = 1.0
    p   = 1.0/gamma
    u   = 0.5
    v   = 0.0

  Vortex centered at x0 = 5.0, y0 = 5.0 - 

                (gamma-1)*b^2                   1     
    rho = ( 1 - ------------- exp(1-r^2) ) ^ (-------)   
                8*gamma*pi^2                  gamma-1 

    p   = rho^gamma

             b        1-r^2
    du  = - --- exp [ ----- ] + (y-y0)^2
            2pi         2

             b        1-r^2
    dv  =   --- exp [ ----- ] + (x-x0)^2
            2pi         2

Instead of solving the discretized PDE, HyPar uses a trained
DMD to predict the solution.

Use Examples/Python/plotSolution_2DBinary.py to plot solutions.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters

+ librom.inp    -   Contains libROM-specific inputs

+ DMD           -   Trained DMD objects; must be located
                    in the directory specified in librom.inp
                    as "dmd_dirname".

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution are not provided. It can be generated 
by compiling aux/exact.c and running the executable in the 
run directory (where solver.inp is present).
