Domain:

  0 <= x or y <= 1.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

  The 2D model is run in pseudo-1D mode by specifying periodic 
  BCs along the other dimension

Initial Solution:

  0 <= x or y < 0.5

    rho = 1.0
    u   = 0
    p   = 1.0

  0.5 <= x or y <= 1.0

    rho = 0.125
    u   = 0
    p   = 0.1

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
