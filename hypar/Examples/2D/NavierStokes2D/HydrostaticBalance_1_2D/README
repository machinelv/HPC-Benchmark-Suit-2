  This test case simulates 2D flow in isothermal equilibrium, 
  with a specified initial pressure perturbation. The equilibrium
  solution is:

  rho(x,y) = rho0 * exp[-(g_x*x+g_y*y)/RT]
  p  (x,y) = p0   * exp[-(g_x*x+g_y*y)/RT]
  
  The strength of the perturbation is specified by eta in 
  aux/init.c. For zero perturbation (eta=0.0), the simulation 
  should show machine-zero residuals.

Domain:

  0 <= x,y <= 1.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:
  see Section 5.5 of the reference.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 

The MATLAB file plot.m plots the solution in MATLAB if the 
output file format is "text".
