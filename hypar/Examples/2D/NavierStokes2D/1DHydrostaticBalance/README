  rho   - density

Well Balanced Test and Small Perturbation of Equilibrium along one dimension:

  This test case simulates 1D flow in isothermal equilibrium, 
  with a specified initial pressure perturbation. The strength
  of the perturbation is specified by eta in aux/init.c. For 
  zero perturbation (eta=0.0), the simulation should show
  machine-zero residuals.

Domain:

  0 <= x or y <= 1.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

  The 2D model is run in pseudo-1D mode by specifying periodic 
  BCs along the other dimension

Initial Solution:

  rho = exp(-x)
  p   = exp(-x) + eta * exp( -100*(x-0.5)^2 )

  or
  
  rho = exp(-y)
  p   = exp(-y) + eta * exp( -100*(y-0.5)^2 )


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
