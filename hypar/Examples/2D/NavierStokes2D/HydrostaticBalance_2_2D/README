                                                           + Viscous terms

  rho   - density
  u,v   - velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  g_x   - acceleration due to gravity in x
  g_y   - acceleration due to gravity in y

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2 + v^2)
        gamma-1      2


2D Well Balanced Test:

  This test case simulates 2D flow in a hydrostatic balance
  with constant potential temperature. The equilibrium
  solution is:

  rho(x,y) = rho0 * [1 - g_y*y/(Cp*theta)] ^ [1/(gamma-1)]
  p  (x,y) = p0   * [1 - g_y*y/(Cp*theta)] ^ [gamma/(gamma-1)]

  where theta is the constant potential temperature. The simulation 
  should show zero residuals to round-off errors.

Domain:

  0 <= x,y <= 1.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:
  see Section 5.5 of the reference.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
