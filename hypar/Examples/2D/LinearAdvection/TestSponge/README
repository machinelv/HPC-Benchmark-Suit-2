2D LINEAR ADVECTION

  du        du       du
  --  + a_x -- + a_y --  = 0
  dt        dx       dy

  -6 <= x <= 6; Dirchlet & Extrapolate
  -3 <= y <= 3; Periodic
  a_x = advection speed along x
  a_y = advection speed along y

Initial Solution:
                               x^2    y^2
  u(x,y,0) = u0(x,y) = exp(- ( ---  + --- ) )

This example tests the implementation of the
sponge boundary condition. The sponge is applied
to the right half of the domain (0 < x <= 6)
and the Gaussian pulse gradually dies out in 
this zone.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
                    (advection speed along each dimension)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
