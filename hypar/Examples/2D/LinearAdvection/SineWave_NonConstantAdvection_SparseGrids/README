2D LINEAR ADVECTION WITH SPATIALLY-VARYING ADVECTION FIELD

  du     d[a_x u]   d[a_y u]
  --  +  -------- + --------  = 0
  dt        dx         dy

  0 <= x,y <= 1; Periodic
  a_x(x,y) = advection speed along x
  a_y(x,y) = advection speed along y

Initial Solution:

  u(x,y,0) = cos (4 pi y) 
  a_x(x,y) = sin(4 pi y)
  a_y(x,y) = -cos(4 pi x)

This example uses the sparse grids methodology to reduce
computational cost of solving a multidimensional problem.

The following input files are required:
+ sparse_grids.inp  -   Sparse grids inputs
+ solver.inp        -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp      -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp       -   Physical parameters (advection field filename)
+ initial.inp       -   Initial solution
                        (can be generated by aux/init.c)
+ advection.inp     -   Advection field
                        (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution and the advection field files in the correct format 
required by the solver.
