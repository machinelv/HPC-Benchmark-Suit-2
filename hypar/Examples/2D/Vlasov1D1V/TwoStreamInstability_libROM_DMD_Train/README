1D-1V VLASOV EQUATION: TWO-STREAM INSTABILITY
WITH libROM DMD TRAINING

  df         df          df
  --  +  v ------  +  E ----  =  0
  dt         dx          dv

   0 <= x <= 2pi;   Periodic
  -6 <= v <= 6; Homogenous Dirichlet


NOTE: This example requires HyPar be compiled
with the FFTW library.

In addition to the evolution of a Riemann problem, a DMD
object is created using libROM and trained on the 
simulation data. The solution is predicted using this
DMD object at the same output times as the actual
simulation.

Use plotSolution.py to plot the HyPar and DMD solutions
and compute/plot the diff between the two.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution

+ librom.inp    -   Contains libROM-specific inputs

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file(s) in the correct format required by the solver.
