1D-1V VLASOV EQUATION: TWO-STREAM INSTABILITY

  df         df          df
  --  +  v ------  +  E ----  =  0
  dt         dx          dv

   0 <= x <= 2pi;   Periodic
  -6 <= v <= 6; Homogenous Dirichlet

NOTE: This example requires HyPar be compiled
with the FFTW library.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file(s) in the correct format required by the solver.
