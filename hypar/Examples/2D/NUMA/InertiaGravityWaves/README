2D NON-HYDROSTATIC UNIFIED MODEL OF THE ATMOSPHERE (NUMA)

Inertia Gravity Wave (2D):

This case simulates the inertia gravity wave problem.

           Element and Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for the 
           Navier-Stokes Equations in Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 300000.0 (meters)
  0 <= y <=  10000.0 (meters)
  No-Flux  boundary conditions (invisid wall) on y boundaries.
  Periodic boundary conditions on x boundaries.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
