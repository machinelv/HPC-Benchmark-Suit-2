  p(x,y): probability
  x     : angle between axis of generator and the magnetic field (theta in paper)
  y     : generator angular speed (omega in paper)
  t     : time

  mu(x,y) = omegaB * (y-omegaS)
  nu(x,y) = (omegaS/2H)[Pm_avg - Pmax sin(x) - D(y-omegaS)]

  (see the reference for other forms of the diffusion operator)
                  
  Physical Parameters:

    omegaB  : base speed
    omegaS  : synchronization speed
    H       : generator intertia
    D       : damping factor
    Pm_avg  : average power input
    Pmax    : EV/X where E is internal voltage, 
                         V is bus voltage,
                         X is total system reactance
    sigma   : square root of variance
    lambda  : correlation time

This is a non-equilibrium case where the initial probability density
function consists of a Dirac located away from an equilibrium point.

For the case with dampingi (D), the probability blob should orbit 
around the equilibrium point.

For the case with some damping, the probability blob should spiral 
towards the equilibrium.


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
