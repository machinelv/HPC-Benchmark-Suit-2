3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

Supersonic Hot Channel Flow:

This problem represents the heating of supersonic flow
through a 2D channel.

The channel dimensions are [0,1] X [0,0.2].

The freestream flow is described as:
  rho_inf = 1.0
  p_inf = 1.0/gamma
  u_inf = 2.0 (Mach 2)
  v_inf = w_inf = 0.0

The boundary conditions are:
  xmin: supersonic inflow with the freestream conditions
  xmax: extrapolate (supersonic outflow)
  ymin: thermal no-slip wall
  ymax: thermal no-slip wall
  zmin: periodic
  zmax: periodic

  The thermal no-slip wall heats the flow to double its
  freestream temperature for x > 0.2

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
                    required for a compact scheme

+ initial.inp
  The code aux/init.c generates the initial solution in the correct
  format needed by HyPar.

+ temperature_ymin_bc.dat, temperature_ymax_bc.dat
  These two files should contain the temperature fields
  at the two y boundaries. They can be generated by compiling 
  and running the file aux/ThermalWallBC.c. 
  - NOTE that the include path for the compilation must have 
    hypar/Extras, i.e., gcc -I/path/to/hypar/Extras/ ThermalWallBC.c
  - Run this code *after* generating initial.inp using 
    aux/init.c

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files
