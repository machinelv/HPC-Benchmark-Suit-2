the 3D model with zero gradients and periodic BCs
along z):

  (Section 3.2)

Domain:

  0 <= x,y <= 1000
  "slip-walls" boundary conditions along x,y

  0 <= z <= 100
  "periodic" boundary conditions along z

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution file (can be generated
                    by compiling and running aux/init.c in
                    the run directory).

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Visualizing the solution in Tecplot or MATLAB:
1)  Make sure op_file_format is set to binary in solver.inp.
2)  Compile and run aux/PostProcess.c after the simulation is
    over.
3a) Choose text output and plot in MATLAB using PlotSolution.m
*or*
3b) Choose Tecplot output and plot in Tecplot.
