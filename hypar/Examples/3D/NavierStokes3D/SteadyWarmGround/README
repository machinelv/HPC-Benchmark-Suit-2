3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

Steady Warm Wall: This case has an initially still atmosphere
in hydrostatic balance with a warm patch of ground below it.

Domain:

  0 <= x,y,z <= 1000

  "thermal-slip-wall" boundary condition at the bottom
  boundary (where the temperature is specified as 10K 
  over the ambient on a disc of radius 100m, and as the
  ambient temperature over the rest of the boundary
  surface)

  "slip-wall" boundary conditions at all other boundaries

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution file (can be generated
                    by compiling and running aux/init.c in
                    the run directory).

+ temperature_data.dat - Since the thermal-slip-wall BC is
  specified at the bottom boundary, this file (containing
  the temperature field at this boundary) is required. It
  can be generated by compiling and running the file
  aux/ThermalWallBC.c. 
  - NOTE that the include path for the compilation must have 
    hypar/Extras, i.e., gcc -I/path/to/hypar/Extras/ ThermalWallBC.c
  - Run this code *after* generating initial.inp using 
    aux/init.c

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Visualizing the solution in Tecplot or MATLAB:
1)  Make sure op_file_format is set to binary in solver.inp.
2)  Compile and run aux/PostProcess.c after the simulation is
    over.
3a) Choose text output and plot in MATLAB using PlotSolution.m
*or*
3b) Choose Tecplot output and plot in Tecplot. 

Extracting a slice and visualizing it:
1)  Make sure op_file_format is set to binary in solver.inp.
2) Create a subdirectory called "slices".
3) Compile and run hypar/Extras/ExtractSlice.c (and let it extract
   the slice along dimension "2", i.e. "z", so that it extracts
   an x-y slice). The slices will be written in binary format.
4) In the subdirectory slices, create a copy of solver.inp
   and physics.inp. Modify them to strip off the z-dimension:
   - in solver.inp, set "ndims" to 2, and remove the z-dimension
     for "size" and "iproc".
   - in physics.inp, remove the 3rd component of "gravity"
5) Compile and run aux/PostProcessSlice.c to convert the binary
   solution file for the slices to Tecplot or plain text files.
   Visualize in Tecplot or MATLAB, respectively.
