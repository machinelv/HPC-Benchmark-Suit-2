  0 <= x,y,z <= 1; Periodic
  a_x = advection speed along x
  a_y = advection speed along y
  a_z = advection speed along z

This example uses the sparse grids methodology to reduce
computational cost of solving a multidimensional problem.

Initial Solution:
  u(x,y,0) = u0(x,y) = sin(2 pi x) sin (2 pi y) sin (2 pi z)
                     
Exact solution:
  u(x,y,t) = u0(x-a_x*t,y-a_y*t,z-a_z*t)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
                    (advection speed along each dimension)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

Notes:-
The code aux/exact.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
It will also generate the exact solution.
