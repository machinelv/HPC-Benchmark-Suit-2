    BASH & MATLAB SCRIPTS
-------------------------------

This folder has some bash and MATLAB scripts which can be used to 
quickly test convergence and errors of numerical schemes.

+ Bash scripts names 'convergence_space_xxx.sh' test the convergence
  properties of the spatial discretization operator for a smooth
  solution of the physical model 'xxx'. The first few lines of the 
  script has several tunable parameters; please set them to 
  appropriate values.

+ MATLAB scripts named 'ConvergenceSpace_xxx.m' test the convergence
  properties of the spatial discretization operator for a smooth
  solution of physical model 'xxx'.

+ Scripts named 'ConvergenceTime_xxx.m' test the convergence
  properties of the time-integration scheme for a smooth 
  solution of physical model 'xxx'.
