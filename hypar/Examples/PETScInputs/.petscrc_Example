# This is an example of a .petscrc file needed to provide
# the inputs to PETSc time integration
# Before starting, it will be useful to briefly go through 
# the documentation, user manuals and examples for PETSc's 
# time-integration (TS) module:
# https://petsc.org/release/docs/manual.pdf (Chapter 6)
# https://petsc.org/release/docs/manualpages/TS/index.html

# Some basic useful input flags are listed here that are needed
# to run a case. See PETSc documentation for more input options
# and flags (or run with "-use-petscts -help" at the command 
# prompt)

# Copy this file to the run directory, rename to ".petscrc" and 
# edit the flags as desired

# Use PETSc time-integration ?
-use-petscts

# Time integration scheme type
# Can be euler,rk,arkimex
-ts_type arkimex

# Specific time integration scheme
# For arkimex, options are 1bee,2a,2e,3,4,5
# For rk, options are 1fe,2a,3,3bs,4,5f,5dp
# These refer to different schemes of different order
# and number of stages.
# See documentation for complete list and explanation
-ts_arkimex_type 4 # 4th order, 5 stage ARKIMEX scheme 

# Time-step adaptivity? (none,basic,advanced)
-ts_adapt_type none

# Print time step information to screen
-ts_monitor

# If time-integration is implicit-explicit, specify
# which terms are implicit and which are explicit

# if hyperbolic flux is not split
-hyperbolic_explicit  # treat hyperbolic term explicitly
# else if it is split as [f(u)-df(u)] + [df(u)]
-hyperbolic_f_explicit  # treat [f(u)-df(u)] explicitly
-hyperbolic_df_implicit # treat [df(u)] implicitly
# the other terms
-parabolic_implicit   # treat parabolic  term implicitly
-source_implicit      # treat source     term implicitly

# If time-integration is implicit or implicit-explicit,
# specify non-linear equation solver (SNES) options
# SNES type
-snes_type newtonls
# **OR**
# for implicit term being linear, tell SNES to only use
# the linear solver (KSP)
-snes_type ksponly
# Set relative tolerance
-snes_rtol 1e-10
# Set absolute tolerance
-snes_atol 1e-10
# Print SNES iteration information to screen
-snes_monitor

# For Newton-type non-linear equation solver, specify
# linear solver (KSP) options
# KSP type
-ksp_type gmres
# Set relative tolerance
-ksp_rtol 1e-10
# Set absolute tolerance
-ksp_atol 1e-10
# Print KSP iteration information to screen
-ksp_monitor

# Other options
-log_summary    # Provide a summary at the end of execution
-help           # Help!
