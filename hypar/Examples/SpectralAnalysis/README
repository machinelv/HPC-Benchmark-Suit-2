    MATLAB SCRIPTS
------------------------------

This folder has some MATLAB scripts which can be used to 
test the spectral properties of numerical schemes.

+ Scripts named 'LinearSpectralAnalysis_Space_xxx.m' test the linear 
  spectral properties of the spatial discretization operators for a 
  suitable example of physical model 'xxx'.

+ Scripts named 'LinearSpectralAnalysis_Time_xxx.m' test the linear 
  spectral properties of the algorithm for various time-integration 
  methods and time step sizes for a suitable example of physical 
  model 'xxx'.
