This folder contains several "ready-to-run" examples for various
number of dimensions and physical models.

Each case has all the required input files. Typically, the initial
solution is not provided, it can be generated by compiling and 
running the provided code (see specific README files in each 
example). 

If the case has a "Run.m" file, and MATLAB is available, then this
script can be used to quickly run a simulation. Just copy the Run.m
file (and no other file) to an emply folder, and execute it using 
MATLAB.

There are some scheme-specific input files, eg:
  lusolver.inp  -> for any compact finite-difference scheme 
                   (eg. CRWENO, HCWENO)
  weno.inp      -> for any WENO-type scheme (WENO, CRWENO, HCWENO)
These are present in the folders for cases using these schemes, 
and so may not be present in all the folders.
If one wants to run some other case with any of these schemes, the
specific input file can be copied over from a folder where it exists.
In its absence, the scheme will still execute using default parameters.

---------------------------
PETSC-SPECIFIC INPUT FILES:
---------------------------

The folder PETScInputs has PETSc-specific input files. These can be 
copied to any folder to run a case with PETSc time-integration.

.petsrc_Example
  This is an example of a ".petscrc" file containing the flags for
  PETSc time integration.
  **Copy and rename it to ".petscrc" to use it**
  The flags can also be provided through the command line.

arkimex_rk3cn2.inp
  This is an example of the input file required to register a 
  custom ARKIMEX time-integration method.
  **Copy and rename it to "time_method.inp" to use it**

rk_ssprk3.inp
  This is an example of the input file required to register a 
  custom RK time-integration method.
  **Copy and rename it to "time_method.inp" to use it**

    MATLAB SCRIPTS
------------------------------

The folder 'Matlab' has some MATLAB scripts which can be used
to quickly test convergence and errors of numerical schemes.

+ Scripts named 'ConvergenceSpace_xxx.m' test the convergence
  properties of the spatial discretization operator for a smooth
  solution of physical model 'xxx'.

+ Scripts named 'ConvergenceTime_xxx.m' test the convergence
  properties of the time-integration scheme for a smooth 
  solution of physical model 'xxx'.

+ Functions named 'Writexxx.m' are functions that write out the
  'xxx' input file for HyPar.

+ Functions named 'Readxxx.m' are functions are read in the files
  written out by HyPar
