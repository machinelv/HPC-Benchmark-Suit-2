1D LINEAR ADVECTION WITH libROM DMD TRAINING

This example requires HyPar to be compiled with libROM.

  du      du
  --  + a --  = 0
  dt      dx

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  a = advection speed

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x)

Exact solution:
  u(x,t) = u0(x-a*t)

In addition to the advection of a sine wave, a DMD
object is created using libROM and trained on the 
simulation data. The solution is predicted using this
DMD object at the same output times as the actual
simulation.

Use plotSolution.py to plot the HyPar and DMD solutions
and compute/plot the diff between the two.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

+ librom.inp    -   Contains libROM-specific inputs

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
