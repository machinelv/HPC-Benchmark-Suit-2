1D LINEAR ADVECTION  WITH libROM DMD TRAINING

  du      du
  --  + a --  = 0
  dt      dx

  -1 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  a = advection speed

Initial Solution: Consists of an exponential, square,
                  triangular and parabolic waves.

Exact solution:
  u(x,t) = u0(x-a*t)

In addition to the advection of a sine wave, time-windowed
DMD objects are created using libROM and trained on the 
simulation data. The solution is predicted using these time-
windowed DMD objects at the same output times as the actual
simulation.

Use plotSolution.py to plot the HyPar and DMD solutions
and compute/plot the diff between the two.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

+ librom.inp    -   Contains libROM-specific inputs

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.

In this case, the exact solution is the same as the initial
solution for an integral number of passes over the the 
periodic domain.
