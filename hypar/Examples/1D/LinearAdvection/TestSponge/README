1D LINEAR ADVECTION

  du      du
  --  + a --  = 0
  dt      dx

  a = advection speed

This example tests the implementation of the sponge 
boundary condition. 

The domain is [-1,3] and the sponge BC is applied
on [1,2.5] so that the waves gradually die out and
the solution approaches the reference value at the
end of the sponge zone.

Initial Solution: Consists of an exponential wave

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
