1D LINEAR ADVECTION WITH SPATIALLY-VARYING ADVECTION SPEED

  du    d[a(x)u]
  --  + -------- = 0
  dt       dx

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  a = a(x) = advection speed

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x)
  a(x) = 1.0 + 0.5 sin(2*pi*x) sin(2*pi*x)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection field filename)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)
+ advection.inp -   Advection field
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution and the advection field files in the correct format 
required by the solver.
