1D LINEAR ADVECTION

  du      du
  --  + a --  = 0
  dt      dx

  -1 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  a = advection speed

Initial Solution: Consists of an exponential, square,
                  triangular and parabolic waves.

Exact solution:
  u(x,t) = u0(x-a*t)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.

In this case, the exact solution is the same as the initial
solution for an integral number of passes over the the 
periodic domain.
