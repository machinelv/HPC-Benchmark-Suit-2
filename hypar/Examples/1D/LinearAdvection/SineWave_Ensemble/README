1D LINEAR ADVECTION (ENSEMBLE SIMULATION)

  du      du
  --  + a --  = 0
  dt      dx

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  a = advection speed

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x)

Exact solution:
  u(x,t) = u0(x-a*t)

This is an example of "ensemble" or multi-domain
simulation, where multiple independent simulations
sharing the same solvers and physics (but differing
grid sizes) are executed together.

Here, 4 simulations with grid sizes 40, 80, 160, and 320
are run together. At the end, the error is reported for each
domain, and they should satisfy the order of convergence.

The following input files are required:
+ simulation.inp  -   Specify the number of simulations/domains to run
+ solver.inp      -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp    -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp     -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial_<n>.inp -   Initial solution
                      (can be generated by aux/init.c)
+ exact_<n>.inp   -   Exact solution (optional)
                      (can be used to compute error norms)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
