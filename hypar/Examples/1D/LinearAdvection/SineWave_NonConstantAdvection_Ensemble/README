1D LINEAR ADVECTION WITH SPATIALLY-VARYING ADVECTION SPEED

  du    d[a(x)u]
  --  + -------- = 0
  dt       dx

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  a = a(x) = advection speed

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x)
  a(x) = 1.0 + 0.5 sin(2*pi*x) sin(2*pi*x)

This is an example of "ensemble" or multi-domain
simulation, where multiple independent simulations
sharing the same solvers and physics (but differing
grid sizes) are executed together.

Here, 4 simulations with grid sizes 40, 80, 160, and 320
are run together. 

The following input files are required:
+ simulation.inp  -   Specify the number of simulations/domains to run
+ solver.inp      -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp    -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp     -   Physical parameters (advection field filename)
+ initial.inp     -   Initial solution
                      (can be generated by aux/init.c)
+ advection.inp   -   Advection field
                      (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution and the advection field files in the correct format 
required by the solver.
