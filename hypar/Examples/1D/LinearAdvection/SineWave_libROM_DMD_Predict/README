1D LINEAR ADVECTION
WITH libROM DMD PREDICTION

This example requires HyPar to be compiled with libROM.

  du      du
  --  + a --  = 0
  dt      dx

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  a = advection speed

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x)

Exact solution:
  u(x,t) = u0(x-a*t)

Instead of solving the discretized PDE, HyPar uses a trained
DMD to predict the solution.

Use Examples/Python/plotSolution_1DBinary.py to plot solutions.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

+ librom.inp    -   Contains libROM-specific inputs

+ DMD           -   Trained DMD objects; must be located
                    in the directory specified in librom.inp
                    as "dmd_dirname".

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
