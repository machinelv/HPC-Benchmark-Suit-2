Small Perturbation Propagation:

  This test case verifies the ability of the solver to propagate
  a small perturbation to the equilibrium accurately.

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 2.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Bottom topography:
  
  b(x) =  0.25 [cos{10pi(x-1.5)}+1] if 1.4 <= x <= 1.6; 0 otherwise

Initial Solution:

  h(x) = 1 - b(x) + eps if 1.1 <= x <= 1.2; 1-b(x) otherwise
  u(x) = 0.0

  eps is the strength of the perturbation. For example,
    eps = 0.2 (big pulse)
    eps = 0.001 (small pulse)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
