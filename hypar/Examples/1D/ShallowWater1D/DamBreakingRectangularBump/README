  dt            dx                               

  h    - water height
  u    - velocity

  b(x) - bottom topography (b_x denotes d[b(x}]/dx)
  g   - acceleration due to gravity

Dam Breaking over a Rectangular Bump:

  Rapidly varying flow over discontinuous bottom topography

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 1500.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Bottom topography:
  
  b(x) =  8.0 if |x-750.0| <= 1500.0/8.0; 0 otherwise

Initial Solution:

  h(x) = 20 - b(x) if x <= 750; 15 - b(x) otherwise
  u(x) = 0.0

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
