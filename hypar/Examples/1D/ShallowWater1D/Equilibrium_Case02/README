  --  [ h*u ] + --  [h*u*u + 0.5*g*h*h ] = [ -g*h*b_x ]
  dt            dx                               

  h    - water height
  u    - velocity

  b(x) - bottom topography (b_x denotes d[b(x}]/dx)
  g   - acceleration due to gravity

Well Balanced Test:

  This test case represents an equilibrium flow. If there are no
  bugs in the implementation, then running this case should give
  machine zero residuals, and the difference between the final 
  and initial solutions should be zero to machine precision.

Domain:

  0 <= x <= 10.0
  "extrapolate" boundary conditions

Bottom topography:
  
  b(x) =  5 exp [ -0.4 (x-5)^2 ]

Initial Solution:

  h(x) = 10.0 - b(x) (h + b = 10)
  u(x) = 0.0

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
