1D LINEAR DIFFUSION

  du       d^2 u
  --  = nu -----
  dt       dx^2

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic
  nu = diffusion coefficient

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x)

Exact solution:
  u(x,t) = e^(-4*pi^2*nu*t)sin(2*pi*x) 

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/exact.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)
+ .petscrc      -   Input file for PETSc time-integration
                    (if not present, then solver will use
                    native time-integration)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/exact.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format
and aux/exact.C is an example that generates it.
