  --  =  --------  +  - q -----

  f(x) = 4x(x^2-1) (drift)
  q = 0.24

Domain:
  -2.5 <= x <= 2.5
  with homogenous Dirichlet 
  boundary conditions:

Initial Solution:
  can be anything except u(x,0) = 0

Exact solution (Steady state):

                2x^2(x^2-2)
  P(x) = N e^(- -----------  )
                    q


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)
+ .petscrc      -   Input file for PETSc time-integration
                    (if not present, then solver will use
                    native time-integration)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
