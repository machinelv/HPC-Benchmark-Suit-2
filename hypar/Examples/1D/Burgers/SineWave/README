1D NONLINEAR BURGERS EQUATION

  du     d (0.5 u^2)
  --  +  ----------  = 0
  dt         dx

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x) / 2*ts*pi
  ts = 2.0

Exact Solution (final time < ts):
  u(x,t) = sin( 2*pi * (x-u(x,t)*t) ) / 2*ts*pi
  Needs to be computed iteratively using
  the fixed point method.


The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
It will be generated by the same code if the final time is 
less than ts.
