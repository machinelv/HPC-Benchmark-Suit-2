SNAP Version 1.12
09/07/2021

SNAP Version 1.12 includes minor revisions to the previous version of SNAP
released to GitHub.

Summary:
SNAP 1.12 replaces the use of omp_set_nested, a deprecated OpenMP feature,
with omp_max_active_levels for nested threading capability. An additional
Figure of Merit (FOM) edit has been provided at the end of the timing summary.
The new FOM is Inverse Grind Time (1/ns), which corresponds to the more
useful interpretation that an increase in its value is an improvement.

The Makefile has been modified to start accounting for the introduction of
the oneAPI compiler on LANL Cray PE systems. This is a work in progress. As
with all Makefile compiler choices, please feel free to ask questions on how
to modify for individual systems.

A new testing input has been added to qasnap/benchmark for posterity. This
input is reflective of a typical single node problem and is useful for
profiling and scaling studies. One other minor testing diff was revealed with
a new version of the Intel compiler (used to generate the original files) and
updated. The qasnap/Readme has been updated.

Please direct questions to the SNAP developers for finer details of the code
changes.
