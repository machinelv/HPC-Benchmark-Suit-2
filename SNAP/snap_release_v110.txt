SNAP Version 1.10
04/06/2020

SNAP Version 1.10 includes minor revisions to the previous version of SNAP
released to GitHub.

Summary:
SNAP 1.10 includes one feature request addition and one algorithm modification.

A negative flux fixup counter has been added to determine how many edges in
the spatial and time domains are corrected per group per inner iteration. The
fixup is reported as a fraction of all unknowns per group per inner iteration.
It is reported when the input file uses the keyword=value "it_det=1". Negative
angular fluxes are unphysical consequences of the approximations made, including
a finite difference closure relationship and finite number of moments to model
the scattering source.

The inner and outer error checks have been modified to reduce the size of the
stack array 'df' in each module. The subroutines inner/outer_conv have been
removed. A smaller df array is computed per group in the new subroutines
inner/outer_df_calc. Calls to this subroutine are threaded. Additional steps
to compute the global errors have been moved to the inner and outer
subroutines. The manual has been updated to describe the changes in the
subroutine names.

The scripts 'quick-check' have been added to the qasnap directories as well
as initial runs on the reference outputs in 'old-iterations'. After running the
tests with 'chkall' one can run 'quick-check' and compare new-iterations and
old-iterations for a quick confirmation that the tests ran correctly. Further
confirmation can come from greater comparison of flux outputs.

Please direct questions to the SNAP developers for finer details of the code
changes.
