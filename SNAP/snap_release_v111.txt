SNAP Version 1.11
06/19/2021

SNAP Version 1.11 includes minor revisions to the previous version of SNAP
released to GitHub.

Summary:
SNAP 1.11 includes some changes for standard adherence and a fix for running
SNAP when built with the MPI=no Make option.

In several places in the code, a comma was missing between two strings that
were separted onto two lines. Comma was added for proper compilation.

When running the code built with MPI=no, the multiswp algorithm was hanging.
Now the code checks for that option whenever nproc=1 (including the MPI=no
build) and resets it to 0.

Please direct questions to the SNAP developers for finer details of the code
changes.
